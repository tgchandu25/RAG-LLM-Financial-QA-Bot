# 🔍 AI-Powered Financial Q&A Bot with RAG and Dual Retrieval

This project is an **AI-powered Q&A chatbot** that answers questions based on 10 quarterly financial PDFs. It uses a combination of **structured** (SQLite) and **unstructured** (vector DB) data to provide accurate, flexible responses. It also supports **trend plots** and **natural language querying** using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a chatbot capable of:
- Extracting financial metrics into a SQL table (`metric_table`)
- Extracting insights and image captions into a vector database for retrieval
- Supporting both **unstructured** and **structured** data queries
- Providing **trend line plots** for metrics over quarters
- Allowing users to **interact through a Gradio interface**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Dual-retrieval pipeline (RAG + SQLite)
- ✅ GPT-3.5-based natural language response
- ✅ Supports trend chart generation (matplotlib)
- ✅ Real-time interaction via Gradio UI
- ✅ Seamless Hugging Face deployment
- ✅ Metric table editor for add/edit/delete metrics

---

## 🧪 Example Questions to Try

- “What is the trend in net profit over the last 8 quarters?”
- “How has the EBITDA margin changed since Q2FY23?”
- “What are the growth projections in Q1FY25?”
- “What did the CEO mention about competitive threats?”

## 🛠️ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Extracting info from images | Used PaddleOCR for visual text extraction |
| Answering both metric and paragraph queries | Integrated dual-retrieval pipeline (RAG + SQL) |
| Ensuring Hugging Face compatibility | Avoided file path issues, used relative paths |

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project showcases a complete, production-grade chatbot capable of handling nuanced financial queries using both structured and unstructured data. Its hybrid architecture ensures versatility in real-world reporting or investor Q&A scenarios. The deployment on Hugging Face enables easy accessibility for demo and testing.
